            <h1>What inspired me to do this project</h1>
            <h5>This Online Bus Track Services website is a website that aims at helping people save the time they spend at bus stops waiting for their ride.<br>This really inspired me a lot because I also experience this multiple times when travelling around Kigali.
                <br>It is very hard and wastes a lot of time waiting for a bus you do not even know is available. So i asked myself, what can i really do as a software engineering student? <br>Luckily alx provided me with a great opportunity of doing a portfolio project.
                I already had a problem in mind and there i got a chance to find a solution to it.
